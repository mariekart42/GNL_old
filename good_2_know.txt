-    BUFFER_SIZE will only be defined while compilation
          -> remove in the end from header

-    no submittig Makefile !! (i only use it cause i'm alpha chad)

-    remove TESTER, .gitignore, this .txt file, .vscode and a.out files



-    dont reallocate ptr on read

-    do not initialize an empty string like thi   *ptr = "";  (undefined behaviour! + gets in the 'read-only' area)
          -> do it like this   *ptr = '\0';

-    no need to free a NULL pointer

-    free only accepts NULL pointer or with malloc allocated pointers
          -> char    *test;

             test = (char *)malloc(20);
             test = "something";
             free(test);
          -> free will not work cause test here is a string literal

-    you can free an allocated pointer in another function! (see test_leaks.c)

-    you have to free after all malloc including functions
